# expense_tracker

A new Flutter project. This expenses tracker app is a project from the Udemy course [Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide [2023 Edition]]. This app is a simple expenses tracker app that allows you to add expenses and view them in a chart. The app is built using Flutter and Dart.

## Things I learned and reviewed in this project:
- How to use Uuid package to generate unique ids for each expense.
- How to use `intl` package to format dates.
- How to use ListView.builder() to build a list of widgets.
- How to use new widgets such as Card().
